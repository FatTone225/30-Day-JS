#README

These projects are the result of doing a 30 day coding challenge administered by Wes Bos through JavaScript30.com. 

The html,css, and media assets were provided, as were instructions for completing the JavaScript.

I have used these projects to further familiarize myself with coding concepts in plain JavaScript without the use 
of libraries to complete the functionality, as per the intention of the course.

Though the finished code was provided in a separate file from Wes, I have gone through and hand coded the JS in 
each project in order to solidify my understanding of the coding concepts. I did not copy and paste.
